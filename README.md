    - Text Search: Locate specific components, assets, or locations.
    - Energy Sensors: Filter to isolate energy sensors.
    - Critical Sensor Status: Identify assets with critical sensor statuses.

#### 2. Technology Stack
- TailwindCSS: For design and styles.

#### 3. Demonstration
Include a video demonstrating the application opening for each company and selecting filters.

#### 4. Future Improvements
If more time were available, I would focus on:

- Implement unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests
- Implement sorting option
